<h1 align="center">Google Sheets Paste to Next Row</h1>
<h2>Automate pasting cells with a click of a button!</h2>
<P>The script automatically finds the last row and groups cells together. You can paste as many new "shipments" or your own templates easily.
   This works great with a user that does not know how to use sheets. You can have a piece of mind now.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li> A check on the current shipment. An alert is shown to the user if the current shipment is not done. The user cannot add a new shipment until all the display stock has been used and all DOAs reported.</li>
  <p></p>
  <li> An alert for the user to confirm adding a new shipment only after current shipment is done.  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li> A check to see if the template format is present. 
      Now the user will get a new alert stating "You just added a new shipment" if they try adding a new shipment immediately . </li>
   <p></p>
  <li> OVERRIDE option to add a new shipment without a check on the current shipment. </li>
</ul>
